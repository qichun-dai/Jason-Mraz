Waiting For My Rocket To Come,2002,You And I Both,"Was it you who spoke the words that things would happen but not to me
Oh things are gonna happen naturally
Oh taking your advice I'm looking on the bright side
And balancing the whole thing
But often times those words get tangled up in lines
And the bright lights turn to night
Until the dawn it brings
Another day to sing about the magic that was you and me

Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
Others only read of the love, the love that I love.

See I'm all about them words
Over numbers, unencumbered numbered words
Hundreds of pages, pages, pages for words
More words then I had ever heard and I feel so alive

Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now,
Oh love, no
You and I, you and I
Not so little you and I anymore, mmm...
And with this silence brings a moral story
More importantly evolving is the glory of a boy

Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now
Well I'm almost finally out of
I'm finally out of
Finally deedeedeedee
Well I'm almost finally, finally
Well I'm free, oh, I'm free

And it's okay if you have to go away
Oh just remember the telephone works both ways
And if I never ever hear them ring
If nothing else I'll think the bells inside
Have finally found you someone else and that's okay
Cause I'll remember everything you sang

Cause you and I both loved what you and I spoke of
and others just read of and if you could see me now
well then I'm almost finally out of.
I'm finally out of, finally, deedeeededede
well I'm almost finally, finally, out of words."
Waiting For My Rocket To Come,2002,I'll Do Anything,"Go make your next choice be your best choice
And if you're looking for a boy with a voice, well baby I'm single
Are you in the mood for some dude, are you in the mood to be subdued
Or would you rather just mingle?
Let's get set then to go then and let us jet set we'll be like the jet-sons
You can be Jane my wife. Should I marry Jane tonight?

I would if I could. I'd do anything spontaneously

Or we can keep chilling like ice cream filling
We can be cool in the gang if you'd rather hang
Ain't no thing. I can be lugubrious with you
I got no ifs ands ors no wits or whats about it
But this place is getting crowded and my house is two blocks away
Or maybe closer

I would if I could. I'd do anything spontaneously
You know I would, if I could. I'll do anything spontaneously

If you could be nimble, you'd have it simple just like me
So go on and try it, do not deny yourself your freedom

So step on up to the plate get a date with Mraz
See you better act fast because supplies they never last
Now did you know this is limited time offer
So go make your mind up before our times up
So you better start winding it up because the party's almost over
(And if you should know girl, go a little bit lower now)

See how I would, if I could. I'd do anything spontaneously
You know I would, and I can prove it. I'll do anything spontaneously"
Waiting For My Rocket To Come,2002,Remedy (I Won't Worry),"Well, I saw fireworks from the freeway
And behind closed eyes, I cannot make them go away
'Cause you were born on the fourth of July, freedom ring
Well, something on the surface, it stings
I said, something on the surface, well, it kinda makes me nervous who says that you deserve this?
And what kind of god would serve this?
We will cure this dirty old disease
Well, if you've gots the poison, I've gots the remedy

The remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I says, the comedy is that it's serious
Which is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When it all amounts to nothing in the end

I, I won't worry my life away
Hey, oh, oh
I, I won't worry my life away
Hey, oh, oh

Well, I heard two men talking on the radio
In a cross fire kind of new reality show
Uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack
While they were counting down the ways to stab the brother in the be right back after this
The unavoidable kiss, where the minty fresh death breath is sure to outlast this catastrophe
Dance with me, 'cause if you've gots the poison, I've gots the remedy

The remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I says the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When it all amounts to nothing in the end

I, I won't worry my life away
Hey, oh, oh
I (I won't, I won't, I won't)
I won't worry my life away
Hey, oh, oh

When I fall in love (I fall in love), I take my time
There's no need to hurry when I'm making up my mind
You can turn off the sun (Turn off the sun), but I'm still gonna shine and I'll tell you why

Because the remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I says the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When it all amounts to nothing in the end

I ('Cause I won't)
I won't worry my life away
Hey, oh, oh
I (I won't, I won't, I won't)
I won't worry my life away
(I won't worry my life)
I (I won't)
I won't worry my life away
I ('Cause I won't, and I won't, and I won't)
Worry my life away
Hey, oh, oh
I (I won't, I won't, I won't)
I won't worry my life away"
Waiting For My Rocket To Come,2002,Who Needs Shelter,"Good-day sunlight
I'd like to say how truly bright you are
You don't know me but I know you
You're my favorite star
Follow you I will so lets get moving

Who needs shelter when the mornings coming?
Absolutely there's no one
Who needs shelter from the sun?
Not me, no. not anyone.

By your clock the cock rooster crows
Then off to work where everybody goes
Slow, But eventually they get there
Picking up the day shift back where all left off
Confined and pecking at relationships
You know it's only a worthless piece of shit

Who needs shelter when the mornings coming?
Absolutely there's no one
Who needs shelter from the sun?
Not me, no. not anyone.

I'd sleep it all away but the sun wont let me
I'd miss those lovely days of summer

Good-day sunlight
I'd like to say how truly bright you are
You don't know me but I know you
You're my favorite."
Waiting For My Rocket To Come,2002,Curbside Prophet,"His after moan though cries oh no
He's building up a shine but he take it slow
And he knows it's time to make a change here And time to get away
And he knows it's time for all the wrong reasons, oh, time to end the pain
But he sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over again
Why don't we?

She said what would your mother think and how would your father react oh lord
Would he take it all back what they've done
No way he said take it, take it and don't break it with your own two hands
That was my old man and he said
if all is grounded you should go make a mountain out of it

oh what a lovely day to have a slice of humble pie
recalling of the while we used to drive and drive here and there
going nowhere but for us, nowhere but for the two of us
and we knew it was time to take a chance here
and time to compromise our lives just a little while
and it was time for all the wrong reasons
but time is often on my side and I give it to you tonight
and we sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over again

as time goes by we get a little bit tired waking and baked another Marlboro mile wide
it's sending the boys on the run in the time in hot summer sun
to swim beneath or over outside as they're reading between the lines
then they remember the part in the hallmark card where they read about the dreams
and reaching for the stars to hold on a little bit closer to
and they knew it was time, time to take a chance here
time to compromise our little lives just a little while
and they knew it was time for all the wrong and, lonely, lonesome reasons, oh
as time is often on my side and I give it to you, oh boy
and we sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over again

She said what would your mother think and how would your father react oh lord
Would he take it all back what they've done
No way he said take it, take it and don't break it with your own two hands
That was my old man and he said
if all is grounded you should go make a mountain out of it"
Waiting For My Rocket To Come,2002,Too Much Food,"You can say that I'm one curly fry in the box of the regular
Messing with the flavor oh the flavor that you savor
Saving me for last but you better not eat me at all
Living in a fast food bag making friends with the ketchup and salt
People say that I'm crazy for not moving on to better things
Instead I'm sitting around trash talking with the onion rings
But it's much too soon to leave this easy life
Pass me the spoon. Pass the analytical knife

Now you're about to get cut up or get cut down
It's all about the wordplay all about the sound in the tone of my voice
You gotta let me make my choice alone before my food gets cold
Better shut up or get shot down. It s all about the know how all just a matter of taste
Stop telling me the way I gotta play. Too much food on my plate.

Believe it or not I super sized my sights on the surprise in the cereal box
My stomachs smaller than my eyes
so I went to see the doctor and he said ""turn your head and then cough""
I didn't listen to what he said instead I couldn't wait to get off
He said I can have this but I cant have that
That I should keep wishing I was living the life of a cat because
I ain't the one whose gonna be missing the feast
Just like you ain't the one who seems to be calming the beast

Now you're about to get cut up or get cut down
It's all about the wordplay all about the sound in the tone of my voice
You gotta let me make my choice alone before my food gets cold
Better shut up or get shot down. It s all about the know how all just a matter of taste
Stop telling me the way I gotta play. Too much food on my plate.

Well if you are what you eat in my case I'll be sweet so come and get some
I'm so over it.

Now you're about to get cut up or get cut down
It s all about the know how all just a matter of taste
Stop telling me the way I gotta play. Too much food on my plate.
(Get up and get some)
there's too much food on my plate"
Waiting For My Rocket To Come,2002,Absolutely Zero,"You. You were a friend. You were a friend of mine I let you spend the night
You see it was my fault. Of course it was mine.
I'm too hard at work. Have you ever heard of anything so absurd ever in your life.
I'm sorry for wasting your time.

See who am I to say this situation isn't great? When it's my job to make the most of it
Of course I didn't know that it would happen to me. Not that easy.

Hey what's that you say? You're not blaming me for anything well that's great
But I don't break that easy. Does it fade away?
So that's why I'm, I'm apologizing now for telling you I thought that we could make it
I just don't get enough to believe that we've both changed.

See who am I to say this situation isn't great? It's my time to make the most of it
Of course I didn't know that it would happen to me. Not that easy.
If all along the fault is up for grabs why can't you have it
If it's for sale what is your offer, I'll sell it for no less than what I bought it for
Pay no more than absolutely zero.

Well neither one of us deserves the blame because opportunities moved us away
And it's not an easy thing to learn to play a game that's made for two that's you and me
The rules remain a mystery. See it can be easy.

See who am I to say this situation isn't great? It's our time to make the most of it
How could we ever know that this would happen to me, not that easy, no
When all along the fault is up for grabs and there you have it
If it's for sale what is your offer, I'll sell it for no less than what I bought it for
Pay no more than absolutely zero."
Waiting For My Rocket To Come,2002,"On Love, In Sadness","Oh love it's a brittle madness, I sing about it in all my sadness
It's not falsified to say that I found god so inevitably well,
It still exists pale and fine. I can't dismiss
And I won't resist and if I die well at least I tried

And we just lay awake in lust and rust in the rain
And pour over everything we say we trust
It happened again, I listened in thru hallways and thin doors
Where the rivers unwind, rust and in the rain endure.
The rust and the rain are sins
And I'm in like Flynn again

So go on place your order now cause some other time is right around the clock
You can stand in line. it finally begins just around the clock
You can have your pick if your stomach is sick whether you eat or not
And there is just one thing that I almost forgot

And we just lay awake in lust and rust in the rain
And pour over everything we say we trust
It happened again, I listened in thru hallways and thin doors
Where the rivers unwind, rust and in the rain so easy
These are the comforts that be

You see well I'm feeling lucky oh well, maybe that's just me
You should be proud of me oh hell if you could only see
That we're gonna grow on up to be, ah yes
We are thick as thieves

Oh love it's a brittle madness, I sing about it in all my sadness
It's not falsified to say that I found god
Inevitably, well it still exists pale and fine I can't dismiss
And I won't resist and if I die well at least I tried

And we just lay awake in lust and rust in the rain
And pour over everything we say we trust
It happened again, I listened in thru hallways and thin doors
Where the rivers unwind and the rust and the rain endure
(the rust and the rain endure. I'm sure.)

I am insofar to know the measure of love isn't loss
Love will never ever be insofar to know the measure of love isn't loss
Love will never ever be lost on me.
Love will never ever be lost on me."
Waiting For My Rocket To Come,2002,No Stopping Us,"Would it take a bakers dozen to get my point to you?
Or would it take a half a pound to roll a joint for you?
Or would it take some hailing Mary's
So full of grace to get my sound to you?
Will you help me break it down and get on through?

Now to the other side, it's easy if you only try, try, try, try
We don't lie down on the job, oh yeah
Because once we hit the top, there's no stopping us, no
Ain't no stopping us

Should I address all my letters to the well to be?
Or should I say return to sender is just a well be done?
Or should I better not take it so personally
If all the good loving is never received?
Baby, if it was me, well, I wouldn't think twice

No not I, I, I, I, I, I, it's easy if you only try, try, try
We don't lie down well on the job or worse it
Because once we hit the top there's no stopping us, no
There's no stopping us, there's no stopping us no, no stopping us

Ooh, I will drive a thousand miles or I'll meet you at the station
If only you would take a vacation from this thing you have created
I promise to make it worth your while
You know, you know that I'll try

So come on try try and baby baby won't you try
It's easy if you do not run
Well I promise you you'll have your fun fun
Because once we hit the top we've just begun
Ooh, there's no stopping us
There's no stopping us yeah
There's no stopping us"
Waiting For My Rocket To Come,2002,Boy's Gone,"The boy's gone. The boy's gone home.

What will happen to a face in the crowd when it finally gets too crowded.
And will happen to the origins of sound after all the sounds have sounded
Well I hope I never have to see that day but by god I know it's headed our way
So I better be happy now that the boy's going home. The boy's gone home.

And what becomes of a day for those who rage against it
And who will sum op the phrase for all left standing around in it

Well I suppose we'll all make our judgement call
We'll walk it alone, stand up tall, then march to the fall
So we better be happy now that we'll all go home.

Be so happy with the way you are
Be so happy that you made it this far
Go on be happy now. Please be happy now

Because this is something else
this is something else

I tried to live my life and live it so well
But when it's all over is it heaven or is it hell
I better be happy now that no one can tell, nobody knows
I'm gonna be happy with the way that I am
I'm gonna be happy with all that I stand for
I'm gonna be happy now because the boy's going home.

The boy's gone home."
Waiting For My Rocket To Come,2002,"Tonight, Not Again","The night.
She brushed her hands upon my flushed cheek
Smelled of childhood remnants of a dusty weeping willow
Clouds soothe, Shredded by the calico
Were oh so vast and quick as I was on my own now.

This time like every other time I believe that I never find
Another sweet little girl with sequined sea foam eyes
Ocean lapping voice smile coy as the brightest quiet span of sky
And I'm all alone again tonight not again, not again, not again.

And don't it feel allright. and don't it feel so nice. Lovely.

Still I'm unable to inhale all the riches
As I'm awkward as a wound on my bones
Still I've got cobblestone joints and plate glass points
As I'm all by myself tonight not again not againE

And don't it feel allright. and don't it feel so nice. Lovely.

Well if you should nervously break down
When its time for the shakedown would you take it
It's when you cry just a little but you laugh in the middle that you've made it
And don't it feel allright. and don't it feel so nice.
Lovely.

Say it again. Lovely. So lovely. to do it again
Again. Loving again. It's coming again.
Lovely."
Mr. A-Z,2005,Life Is Wonderful,"It takes a crane to build a crane
It takes two floors to make a storey
It takes an egg to make a hen
It takes a hen to make an egg
There is no end to what I'm saying

It takes a thought to make a word
And it takes some words to make an action
It takes some work to make it work
It takes some good to make it hurt
It takes some bad for satisfaction

La la la la la la la life is wonderful
Ah la la la la la la life goes full circle
Ah la la la la la la life is wonderful
Al la la la la

It takes a night to make it dawn
And it takes a day to make you yawn brother
And it takes some old to make you young
It takes some cold to know the sun
It takes the one to have the other

And it takes no time to fall in love
But it takes you years to know what love is
It takes some fears to make you trust
It takes those tears to make it rust
It takes the dust to have it polished

Ha la la la la la la life is wonderful
Ah la la la la la la life goes full circle
Ah la la la la la la life is so full of
Ah la la la la la la life is so rough
Ah la la la la la la life is wonderful
Ah la la la la la la life goes full circle
Ah la la la la la la life is our love
Ah la la la la la

It takes some silence to make sound
It takes a loss before you found it
And it takes a road to go nowhere
It takes a toll to make you care
It takes a hole to make a mountain

Ah la la la la la la life is wonderful
Ah la la la la la la life goes full circle
Ha la la la la la life is wonderful
Ha la la la la la life is meaningful
Ha la la la la la life is wonderful
Ha la la la la la life it is...so... wonderful
It is so meaningful
It is so wonderful
It is meaningful

Wonderful
Meaningful
Full circle

Mr. A-Z,2005,Wordplay,"I've been all around the world
I've been a new sensation
But it doesn't really matter
In this generation
The sophomore slump is an uphill battle
And someone said that ain't my scene
'Cause they need a new song
Like a new religion
Music for the television
I can't do the long division
Someone do the math
For the record label puts me on the shelf up in the freezer
Got to find another way to live the life of leisure
So I drop my top
Mix and I mingle
Is everybody ready for the single and it goes...

[Chorus]
Ha La La La La
Now listen closer to the verse I lay
(Ha La La La La)
It's all about the wordplay
(Ha La La La Love)
The wonderful thing it does
Because, because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's
Yeah the Mister A to Z
They say I'm all about the wordplay

When it's time to get ill I got your remedy
For those who don't remember me
Well let me introduce you to my style
I try to keep a jumble
And the lyrics never mumble
When the music's makin' people tongue-tied
You want a new song
Like a new religion
Music for the television
I can't do the long division
Someone do the math
For the people write me off like I'm a one-hit wonder
Gotta find another way to keep from goin' under
Pull out the stops
Got your attention
I guess it's time again for me to mention
The wordplay

[chorus]
Ha La La La La
Now listen closer to the verse I lay
(Ha La La La La)
It's all about the wordplay
(Ha La La La Love)
The wonderful thing it does
Because, because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's
Yeah the Mister A to Z
They say I'm all about the wordplay

I built a bridge across the stream my consciousness
It always seems to be a flowin'
But I don't know which way my brain is goin'
Oh the ryhmin' and the timin'
Keeps the melodies inside me
And they're comin'
Till I'm running out of air
Are you prepared to take a dive into the deep end of my head
Are you listening to a single word I've said

Ha La La La La
Listen closer to the words I say
Ha La La La La
I'm stickin' to the wordplay
Ha La La La Love
The wonderful thing it does
Because, because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's
Yeah the Mister A to Z
They say I'm all about the wordplay

Ha La La La La
I'm all about the wordplay
Ha La La La La
Stickin' with the wordplay
Ha La La La Love
I love the wonderful thing it does
Because, because
The ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's fall back in love
For the Mister A to Z they say
Is all about the wordplay"
Mr. A-Z,2005,Geek In The Pink,"Yo, brother A to Z
Yo, whassup B?
Yo, what time is it?
Haha

It's laundry day

Well, let the geek in the pink take a stab at it
If you like the way I'm thinkin', baby, wink at it
I may be skinny at times but I'm fat fulla rhymes
Pass me the mic and I'm a grab at it

Well, isn't it delicious, crazy way that I'm kissin'
'Cause baby listen to this, don't wanna miss it while it's hittin'
Sometimes you gotta fit in to get in
But don't ever quit 'cause soon I'm gonna let you in, but see

I don't care what you might think about me
You'll get by without me if you want

Well I could be the one to take you home
Baby we could rock the night alone
If we never get down
It wouldn't be a let down
But sugar don't forget what you already know

That I could be the one to turn you out
We could be the talk across the town
Don't judge it by the color,
Confuse it for another
You might regret what you let slip away

Like the geek in the pink
Like the geek in the pink
The geek in the pink

Well my relationship fodder don't mean to bother nobody
But Cupid's automatic must've fired multiple shots at her
Because she fall in love too often that's what the matter
At least I'm talking about it keep my pattern of flattery and

She was starin' through the doorframe
And eying me down like already a bad boyfriend
Well she can get her toys outta the drawer then
'Cause I ain't comin' home I don't need that attention, see

I don't care what she might think about me
She'll get by without me if she wants

Well I could be the one to take her home
Baby we could rock the night alone
If we never get down
It wouldn't be a let down
But sugar don't forget what you already know

That I could be the one to turn you out
We could be the talk across the town
Don't judge it by the color
Confuse it for another
You might regret what you let slip away

Hey baby look at me go
From zero to hero
You better take it from a geek like me
Well, I can save you from unoriginal dum-dums
Who wouldn't care if you complete them or not

So what I've got a short attention span
A coke in my hand
Because I'd rather have the afternoon, relax and understand
My hip hop and flip-flops, well it don't stop with the light rock
My shot to mock you kinda puts me in the tight spot

The hype is nothing more than hoo-ha so
I'm developing a language and I'm callin' it my own
So take a peek into the speaker and you'll see what I mean
That on the other side the grass is greener

I don't care what you might think about me
You'll get by without me if you want

I could be the one to take you home
Baby we could rock the night alone
If we never get down
It wouldn't be a let down
But sugar don't forget what you already know

I could be the one to turn you out
We could be the talk across the town
Don't judge it by the color
Confuse it for another
You might regret what you let slip away

Like the geek in the pink
Well, I'm the geek in the pink, yo
Geek is the color for fall,
I'm the geek in the pink
So I'm the geek yo, in the pink yo.
Geek is the color for fall
I'm the geek in the pink"
Mr. A-Z,2005,Did You Get My Message?,"Did you get my message, the one I left
While I was trying to condense everything
That I meant in a minute or less when I called to confess
And make all of my stresses go bye-bye

Did you get my message, you did not guess
'cuz if you did you would have called me with your sweet intent
And we could give it a rest
'stead of beating my breast
Making all of the pressure go sky-high

Do you ever wonder what happens to the words that we send
Do they bend, do they break from the flight that they take
And come back together again with a whole new meaning
In a brand new sense, completely unrelated to the one I sent

Did you get my message, oooh oooh ooooh
Did you get my message, oooh oooh ooooh
Did you get my message, yeah, oooh oooh ooooh hooo

Uh oh, where did it go, must have bopped past your phone
And fallen right outta the window
[Rachel Yamagata:] ooh well, how can I tell?
Shoulda called the operator maybe she know the info
But whether or not my message you got was too much or a lot to reply
[Rachel Yamagata:] why not try this for a fact
Should you ever come back I'd relax and feel relieved
Before my panic attack

Ahh hooo oooh
Did you get my message, oooh oooh ooooh
Did you get my message, oooh oooh ooooh
Did you get my message, yeah oooh oooh ooooh hooo

Did you get my message, the one that I left
While I was trying to condense everything that I meant
[Rachel Yamagata:] Now the moment is passed
Not much sand in the glass and I'm standing to lose my mind
Do you ever wonder what happens to the words that we send
So they bend, do they break from the flight that they take
And come back together again with a whole new meaning
To the matter of our love's defense, and please be sympathetic to the time I spent

Did you get my message, oooh oooh ooooh
Did you get my message, oooh oooh ooooh
Did you get my message, yeah oooh oooh ooooh hooo
Did you get my message
[Rachel Yamagata:] no I didn't hear a word you said
Did you get my message
[Rachel Yamagata:] no I'm not gonna believe your lies anymore
Did you get my message that I want to reconnect with you
Did you get my message
[Rachel Yamagata:] I can hear you say your coming but I don't hear
Why did you get the message love ?
That I want to get back with you
Did you get my message love
That I want to reconnect with you
Why did you get the message love ?

Are you killing me?
You took care of the cat already.
And for those who think it's heavy.
Is it the truth or is it only gossip?

Call it mystery or anything
Just as long as you'd call me.
I sent the message on.
Did you get it when I left it?
See this catastrophic event
It wasn't meant to mean no harm
But to think there's nothing wrong is a problem

I'm looking for love this time
Sounding hopeful but it's making me cry
Love is a mystery
Mr. Curious
Come back to me

Mr. Waiting-Ever-Patient, can't you see
That I'm the same the way you left me
In a hurry to spell-check me?
And I'm underlined already in envy green and pencil red
And I've forgotten what you said.
Will you stop working for the dead and return?

Mr. Curious, well, I need some inspiration.
It's my birthday and I cannot find no cause for celebration.
The scenario is grave, but I'll be braver when you save me
From this situation laden with hearsay.

I'm looking for love this time
Sounding hopeful, but it's making me cry.
And love is a mystery.
Mr. Curiosity,
Be Mr. Please-Do-Come-And-Find-Me

Find me
Find me
Find me

Re mi
Come and save
Waiting ever
...

I'm looking for love this time
Sounding hopeful, but it's making me cry.
Trying not to ask why
This love is a mystery.
Mr. Curiosity,
Be Mr. Please-Do-Come-And-Find-Me

Love is blinding when the timing's never right.
Oh who am I to beg for difference
Finding love in just an instant?
Well, I don't mind.
At least I've tried, well, I tried, I tried."
Mr. A-Z,2005,Clockwatching,"Take off, both your, shoes and clothes, I'll follow.
Undo, corkscrew, drink from the top of a broken bottle.
Lately we're running out of time, aren't we?

Smoking, often, and calling out our guilty pleasures,
Let's keep, talking, anything to stop clockwatching.
Lately we're running out of time, aren't we?
Crazy for running all the time, m-m-m-m-maybe.
Let's forget we're running out of time.

I'm off like an airplane,
I'm licking your postage stamp again.
I'm using my right brain and I'm praying that we don't crash.
Who knew I'd cum so fast.
Well so what if a two pump chump can't last.

But I made it to three, and I foreclose a five minute, fantasy.
On a short-lived flight, making love on economy
No jumping, conclusions,
I don't think there's no solution,
Let's get, backwards,
And forget our restless destination.

Let's live in this moment just this time, could we?
Just take one moment of our time m-m-m-m-maybe.
Let's forget we running out of time.

I'm off like an airplane,
I'm catching my second wind again.
I'm using my left brain
And I'm righting all my wrongs.
I'm yearning to turn you on.

I've been working on getting you off, so get on board.
Well how can I guess by the subject of the best predicate that's left unsaid when the matter is too delicate.
My loneliness is evident.

And its you,
You're running through my mind and it makes me c-c-crazy cra-cra-crazy.

La la la
La la la la la
La la la (ooooooo, so amazing)
La la la la la la

Laaaa oh oh
Laaaaaa lo oh oh oh

Lady, dreamer, you might be the soundest sleeper,
Tonight, sleep tight, and build your nest upon my shoulder."
Mr. A-Z,2005,Bella Luna,"Mystery the moon
A hole in the sky
A supernatural nightlight
So full but often wry
A pair of eyes, a closing one
A chosen child of golden sun
A marble dog that chases cars to farthest reaches of the beach
And far beyond into the swimming sea of stars

The cosmic fish they love to kiss
They're giving birth to constellations
No riffs and oh no reservation
If they should fall you'd get a wish or dedication

May I suggest you get the best
For nothing less than you and I
Let's take a chance as this romance is rising
Oh, before we lose the lighting

Oh Bella Bella please
Bella you beautiful luna
Oh Bella do what you do

You are an illuminating anchor of leagues too infinite in number
For crashing waves and breaking thunder
Tiding the ebb and flows of hunger

You're dancing naked there for me you expose all memory
You make the most of boundary
You're the ghost of royalty imposing love
You are the queen and king combining everything
Intertwining like a ring around the finger
Of a girl
Look, I'm just a singer, you're the world
All I can bring ya is a language of a lover

Bella Luna
My beautiful, beautiful moon
How you swoon me like no other

May I suggest you get the best of your wish
May I insist at no contest for little you or smaller I
A larger chance set but all them are lie
On the rise, on the brink of our lives

Bella please
Bella you beautiful luna
Oh, Bella do what you do

My beautiful, beautiful moon
How you swoon me like no other"

Clean out the reds in my eyes to get by security lines
Dear x-ray machine
Pretend you don't know me so well
I won't tell if you lied
Cry 'cause your droughts been brought up
Drinkin' 'cause you're looking so good in your Starbucks cup
I complain for the company that I keep
The windows for sleeping rearrange
Well I'm nobody
Well who's laughing now

I'm leaving your town again
And I'm over the ground that you've been spinning
And I'm up in the air said baby hell yeah
Well honey I can see your house from here
If the plane goes down, damn
Well I'll remember where the love was found
If the plane goes down, damn

Damn, I should be so lucky
Even only 24 hours under your touch
You know I need you so much
I cannot wait to call you
And tell you that I landed somewhere
And hand you a square of the airport
And walk you through the maze of the map
That I'm gazing at
Gracefully unnamed and feeling guilty for the luck
And the look that you gave me
You make me somebody
Oh nobody knows me
Not even me can see it, yet I bet

I'm leaving your town again
And I'm over the ground that you've been spinning
And I'm up in the air, said baby hell yeah
Oh honey I can see your house from here
If the plane goes down, damn
I'll remember where the love was found
If the plane goes down, damn

You keep me high-minded
You keep me high

Flax seeds, well they tear me open
And supposedly you could crawl right through me
Taste these teeth please
And undress me from the sweaters better hurry
'Cause I'm heating upward bound now
Oh maybe I'll build my house on your cloud
Here I'm tumbling for you
Stumbling through the work that I have to do
Don't mean to harm you

By leaving your town again
But I'm over the quilt that you've been spinning
But I'm up in the air, said baby hell yeah
Oh honey I can see your house from here
If the plane goes down, damn
I'll remember where the love was found
If the plane goes down, damn
I'll remember where the love was found

Mr. A-Z,2005,O. Lover,"What's the worst thing that could happen?
We could change our minds.
That seems to be the hottest topic at this time.
We are sitting around in the meditation, dragging, chasing,
Wonderin?whose holdin?whose got the will to draw the line.

I know you've got something burning up inside,
It's so unhealthy but so good for me, oh!
Said if I didn't know, and if I didn't know, well if I didn't know that you loved me would you tell me?
Well God only knows our contradiction's to quitting, is a hate to love relationship thing.
A fire under you is so fulfilling,
I fear there's nothing more.

I'm giving, giving you, the choke hold,
My flirting with disaster is mighty loved.
Ugggh you, you're so bold,
My wanting to kiss you still is not enough.
I'm getting over, all the comments.
I'm feeling statements made by people are nonsense.
I'm getting stronger, by the minute.
And once I slip into position I'll swing you and turn you all around.

You are the sweetest thing I've found since whenever,
You're the only way my time is measured.
You might be the silent type,
But your appetizing louder now.
It's crazy how you're killing me.
Woo, you're killing me, but I like your

Red top and matching bottoms.
You know the ones, the ones you got on,
Pull them over your skinny self
But don't cover your tattoo.
Woo, cause I like to look at you, yeah,
I love that smell on you,
And I got your special place against this face for tasting too.

And I like it natural,
No need for chemicals.
Foggin?up my senses
You're making me sensless
You're calling it sexual.

And you're going to get yours, my lady.
Might even be today.
And it ain't no thing because I'll be rolling right along with you-woo-woo.

You are the sweetest thing I've found since whenever.
You're the only way my time is measured.
You might be the silent type.
But you're appetizing louder now.
It's crazy how you're killing me.
And give us both a break.
And to give us back a taste when the way things were before they made the laws,
And to give us both a chance,
But it won't be the last romance cause when the weekend starts the guilty party's on.

[Scatting]

BREAKDOWN!!
Weekend party's over,
Don't stop, let's get closer.
Friday, got cold shoulder,
Monday, got a new composure.

Weekend party's over,
Don't stop, let's get lower.
I won't blow your cover,
Opportunistic lover.

Weekend party's over,
Don't stop, let's get closer.
Friday's mediocre,
Monday, I'm self-exposed now.

Weekend party's over,
Don't stop, let's suppose-ah
I won't blow your cover
Opportunistic lover."
Mr. A-Z,2005,Please Don't Tell Her,"I hear she's kicking ass across the board and rock two hundred thousand higher scorer
Just in time to save the world of being taken over
She's a warrior
I couldn't play again because the game it never ended it never even landed on the can
And never let me in to spend my quarter
There's no love for me no more

Say it isn't so
How she easily come, and she easy go
Please don't tell her that I've been meaning to miss her
Because I don't

She was the girl with the broadest shoulders
But she would die before I crawled over them
She is taller than I am
She knew I wouldn't mind the view there
Or the altitude with a mouth full of air
She let me down the doubt came out until the now became later

Say that it isn't so
How she easily come, how she easy go
Please don't tell her that
'Cause she don't really need to know

That I'm crazy like the rest of us
And I'm crazier when I'm next to her

So why after the all of everything that came and went
I care enough to still be singing of the bitter end and broken eras
I told you I don't but
I am only trying to be the best with my intent to cure
The rest is sure to lay me ease the plural hurts of the words of reverse psychology
That's easier said
Easier than done
Please don't dare tell her what I've become
Please don't mention all the attention I have drawn
Please don't bother cause she'll feel guilty when I'm gone

Because I'm crazy like the rest of us
But I'm crazier when I'm next to her
And it's amazing how she's so self-assured
But I know she'd hate me if she knew my words
Do I hurt anymore
Do I hurt, well
I don't
I don't
I don't"
Mr. A-Z,2005,Forecast,"Well I heard that it might be raining bed sheets and lover's words
Let's throw out the hotel comforter and hang the 'do not disturb'
Sign me up for the storm
I'll wear my suit for the shower
Cause I'll have you to keep me warm in the coldest hour

And when the darkness falls under your hair, there I'll be
And crazy is the forecast all week

Well every kiss, every hug is so light on that touch, delicate like a snowflake
Well I can taste, I can taste, I can taste, I can taste you all over my face
And everyone might find it foolish to not be counting on the sun
But your mouth is my umbrella now
Because I'm holding your tongue

And when the darkness falls under your hair, there I'll be
And crazy is the forecast all week

There's a good chance in hell
Like cats and dogs we'll be flying
And I'm no weatherman
But you are lightning, striking

Here comes that sun
Want rain
All at once
How it sing

In the midst of the morning pull up a blanket of a cloud
And await for the warning of another come down
Because the water is healthy for the roses in your cheeks
My well holds plenty for penny wishin' in your deep end
And when the lights go out, no doubt, with you I'll be

And crazy is the forecast all week

And if them rains should fall for sure with you I'll be
Ah because crazy is the forecast all week long
Crazy is the forecast"
Mr. A-Z,2005,Song For A Friend,"Well you're magic he said
But don't let it all go to your head
Cuz I bet if you all had it all figured out
Then you'd never get out of bed
No doubt
Of all the thing's that I've read what he wrote me
Is now sounding like the man I was hoping
To be
I Keep on keeping it real
Cause it keeps getting easier, he'll see
He's the reason that I'm laughing
Even if there's no one else
He said, you've got to love yourself

You say, you shouldn't mumble when you speak
But keep your tongue up in your cheek
And if you stumble onto something better remember that it's humble that you seek
You got all the skill you need,
Individuality
You got something
You call it gumption
You call it anything you want
Because when you play the fool now
You're only fooling everyone else
You're learning to love yourself

Yes you are

There's no price to pay
When you give and what you take,
That's why it's easy to thank you
You...

Let's say take a break from the day
And get back to the old garage
Because life's too short anyway
But at least it's better then average
As long as you got me
And I got you
You know we'll got a lot to go around
I'll be your friend
Your other brother
Another love to come and comfort you
And I'll keep reminding
If it's the only thing I ever do
I will always love
I will always love you
Yes you
I will always, always, always, always love
I will always, always love
I will always, always love, love

Climb up over the top.
Survey the state of the soul.
You've got to find out for yourself whether or not you're truly trying.
Why not give it a shot?
Shake it. Take control and inevitably wind up
Find out for yourself all the strengths you have inside of you."
"We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things",2008,Make It Mine,"Wake up everyone
How can you sleep at a time like this
Unless the dreamer is the real you
Listen to your voice
The one that tells you to taste past the tip of your tongue
Leap and the net will appear

I don't wanna wake before
The dream is over
I'm gonna make it mine
Yes I, I know it
I'm gonna make it mine
Yes I'll make it all mine

I keep my life on a heavy rotation
Requesting that it's lifting you up
Up up and away
And over to a table at the Gratitude Café

And I am finally there
And all the angels they'll be singing
Ah la la la ah la la la I la la la la love you

Well I don't wanna break before
The tour is over
I'm gonna make it mine
Yes I... I'll own it
I'm gonna make it mine

And this time there's plenty
I am balancing
Careful and steady
And reveling in energy that everyone's emitting

Well I don't wanna wait no more
Oh I wanna celebrate the whole world
I'm gonna make it mine
Oh yes I'm following your joy
I'm gonna make it mine
Because I... I am open

Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon, it's again my turn
To win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate
No more, no more
It cannot wait
I'm yours

Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
And look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved

So I won't hesitate
No more, no more
It cannot wait
I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate
I'm yours

But don't you want to come on and scooch on over closer, dear
And I will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed

I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate
No more, no more
It cannot wait
I'm yours

Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
So please don't, please don't, please don't
There's no need to complicate
'Cause our time is short
This oh, this oh, this is our fate

To an island where we'll meet

I'll put a flower in your hair

Though the breezes through the trees
Move so pretty you're all I see
As the world keeps spinning round
You hold me right here right now

Practicing their loving for you

"We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things",2008,Love For A Child,"There's a picture on my kitchen wall
Looks like Jesus and his friends involved
There's a party getting started in the yard
And there's a couple getting steamy in the car parked in the drive
Was I too young to see this with my eyes?

And by the pool that night, apparently
The chemicals weren't mixed properly
You hit your head and then forgot your name
And then you woke up at the bottom by the drain
And now your altitude and memory's a shame

What about taking this empty cup and filling it up
With a little bit more of innocence
I haven't had enough, it's probably because when you're young
It's okay to be easily ignored
I'd like to believe it was all about love for a child

And when the house was left in shambles
Who was there to handle all the broken bits of glass
Was it mom who put my dad out on his ass or the other way around
Well I'm far too old to care about that now

What about taking this empty cup and filling it up
With a little bit more of innocence
I haven't had enough, it's probably because when you're young
It's okay to be easily ignored
I'd like to believe it was all about love for a child

It's kinda nice to work the floor since the divorce
I've been enjoying both my Christmases and my birthday cakes
And taking drugs and making love at far too young an age
And they never check to see my grades
What a fool I'd be to start complaining now

What about taking this empty cup and filling it up
With a little bit more of innocence
I haven't had enough, it's probably because when you're young
It's okay to be easily ignored
I'd love to believe it was all about love for a child

It was all about love..."

the coyotes sing when they call on your lovin.

Coming back for more,
You know I'm coming for you
You know we should be should be together
'cause once we rock, we won't wanna stop
Not today not tomorrow.
You better lock your doors
You know why, cause we want you
'cause we like you a lot

I wish the world was alive like you.
I wish the world would help me through
Another opportunity to approach you
Another telepathic rendezvous
I wish you well with your weapon of jargon
You've got a double-sided lexicon
I got to try to keep your attention
Gotta write using less emoticons
Gotta figure out the snooze alarm
I wanna lay in your place till dawn
I wanna play in the park come on, now
Let me see your other upper echelon

And when the coyotes escape to new york
Then the city life has crumbled to the sea
And the girls all fall to the lost and found
The flying man'll hit the ground
Every motion is closer to touching
The coyotes sing when they feast on your lovin'

I'm a coyote and I got a taste for your lovin'

We're coming back for more,
You know I'm coming for you
You know we should be; we should be together
'Cause once we rock, we won't want to stop
Not today or tomorrow.

Not today or tomorrow, oh no

Because once we rock, we won't want to stop
Not today or tomorrow."
"We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things",2008,Only Human,"A squirrel in the tree is he watching me
Does he give a damn?
Does he care who I am?
I'm just a man, is that all I am
Are my manners misinterpreted words or only human?
I'm human

Murderous crow, hey what you know
What you reading about, what you hold in your toes
Is that a twig, are you a dove of peace
A black dove undercover, with another puzzle piece
Are you a riddle to solve all along?
Or am I over thinking thoughts of human after all

Only human
Made of flesh, made of sand, made of human
The planet's talking about a revolution
The natural laws ain't got no constitution
They've got a right to live their own life
But we keep paving over paradise

'Cause we're only human
Yes we are, only human
If it's our only excuse do you think we'll keep on being only human
Yes we are, yes we are
Only human, only human, only human
So far:

Up in the major's tree, the one he planted back when he was just a boy
Back in 1923
Thirty meters and a foot, take a look, take a climb
What you'll find is the product of a seed
The seed is sown, all alone
It grows above, with a heart of love
Sharp and shelter of the animals of land and cold weather breathing
We're all breathing in

The planet's talking about a revolution
The natural laws ain't got no constitution
They've got a right to live their own life
But we keep paving over paradise

'Cause we're only human
Yes we are, only human
If it's our only excuse do you think we'll keep on being only human
Yes we are, only human, only human, so far, so far

And this place it will outlive me
Before I get to heaven I'll climb that tree
And I will have to give my thanks
For giving me the branch to swing on
If I ever fall in love
I'll have to give myself a baby
I will let my children have their way

'Cause we're only human, yes we are
Only human, so far, so far"

The po-pole position
Automatic transmission with lo-ow emissions
I'm a brand new addition to the old edition
With the love unconditional

Then I'm a drama abolitionist
Damn no opposition to my proposition
Half of a man, half magician
Half a politician holding the mic
Like ammunition
And my vision is as simple as light

Ain't no reason we should be in a fight
No demolition

Compositions already written by themselves

While waiting for guns and the roses
To finish what we all suppose is
Gonna be the shit, so sue me

Twisting up a rizla
Kid Icarus on the transistor
Nintendo been givin' me the blister
I bend over take it in the kisser

My best friends are hittin' on my sister
Try to tell them that they still wish-a

I do not sleep without a mistress
I do not eat unless it's fixed with
Some kind of sweet like a licorice
My home is deep inside the mystics
I'm known to keep digging on existence
I'm holdin' in the heat like a fishstick
My phone it beeps because I missed it

I do not answer the call if
I do not know who is calling
I'm making no sense of it all
Say, can I get a witness?

I'm only a boy in a story
Just a hallucinatory
Trippin' on nothing there is
Living in the wilderness

With a tiger spot on my back
Living life of a cat
I just wanna relax here
And write another rap tune
Driving off on your blind man's bike
You can say just what you like
Or nothing can stop you

"We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things",2008,If It Kills Me,"Hello, tell me you know
Yeah, you figured me out
Something gave it away
It would be such a beautiful moment
To see the look on your face
To know that I know that you know now

And baby that's a case of my wishful thinking
You know nothing
Well you and I
Why, we go carrying on for hours on end
We get along much better
Than you and your boyfriend

[Chorus:]
Well all I really wanna do is love you
A kind much closer than friends use
But I still can't say it after all we've been through
And all I really want from you is to feel me
As the feeling inside keeps building
And I will find a way to you if it kills me
If it kills me

How long, can I go on like this,
Wishing to kiss you,
Before I rightly explode?
This double life I lead isn't healthy for me
In fact it makes me nervous
If I get caught I could be risking it all

Cause maybe there's a lot that I miss
In case I'm wrong

[Chorus]

If I should be so bold
I'd ask you to hold my heart in your hand
I'd tell you from the start how I've longed to be your man
But I never said a word
I guess I'm gonna miss my chance again

All I really wanna do is love you
A kind much closer than friends use
But I still can't say it after all we've been through
And all I really want from you is to feel me
As the feeling inside keeps building
And I will find a way to you if it kills me
If it kills me
If it kills me
I think it might kill me

And all I really wanna do is to feel you
Yeah, the feeling inside keeps building
I'll find a way to you if it kills me

It might kill me"
"We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things",2008,A Beautiful Mess,"You've got the best of both worlds
You're the kind of girl who can take down a man,
And lift him back up again
You are strong but you're needy,
Humble but you're greedy
And based on your body language,
And shoddy cursive I've been reading

Your style is quite selective,
Though your mind is rather reckless
Well, I guess it just suggests
That this is just what happiness is

And what a beautiful mess this is
And it's like we're picking up trash in dresses

Well, it kind of hurts when the kind of words you write
Kind of turn themselves into knives
And don't mind my nerve you could call it fiction
But I like being submerged in your contradictions, dear
'Cause here we are, here we are

Although you were biased I love your advice
Your comebacks ‒ they're quick
And probably have to do with your insecurities
There's no shame in being crazy,
Depending on how you take these
Words I'm paraphrasing this relationship we're staging

And what a beautiful mess this is
It's like picking up trash in dresses

Well, it kind of hurts when the kind of words you say
Kind of turn themselves into blades
And ""kind and courteous"" is a life I've heard
But it's nice to say that we played in the dirt, oh dear,
'Cause here, here we are, here we are
Here we are [7x]

We're still here
What a beautiful mess this is
It's like taking a guess when the only answer is ""Yes""

And through timeless words and priceless pictures
We'll fly like birds not of this earth

And tides ‒ they turn ‒ and hearts disfigure
But that's no concern when we're wounded together

And we tore our dresses and stained our shirts
But it's nice today. Oh, the wait was so worth it."

Love Is A Four Letter Word,2012,Living In The Moment,"If this life is one act
Why do we lay all these traps?
We put them right in our path
When we just wanna be free

I will not waste my days
Making up all kinds of ways
To worry about all the things
That will not happen to me

So I just let go of what I know I don't know
And I know I'll only do this by
Living in the moment
Living our life
Easy and breezy
With peace in my mind
With peace in my heart
Peace in my soul
Wherever I'm going, I'm already home
Living in the moment

I'm letting myself off the hook for things I've done
I let my past go past
And now I'm having more fun
I'm letting go of the thoughts
That do not make me strong
And I believe this way can be the same for everyone

And if I fall asleep
I know you'll be the one who'll always remind me
To live in the moment
To live my life
Easy and breezy
With peace in my mind
With peace in my heart
Got peace in my soul
Wherever I'm going, I'm already home

I can't walk through life facing backwards
I have tried
I tried more than once to just make sure
And I was denied the future I'd been searching for
But I spun around and hurt no more
By living in the moment
Living my life
Easy and breezy
With peace in my mind
With peace in my heart
Got peace in my soul
Wherever I'm going, I'm already home

I'm living in the moment
I'm living my life
Just taking it easy

Got peace in my heart
Got peace in my soul

You're not welcome anymore
And you beat yourself up
You let yourself get mad
And in those times when you stop lovin'

Some even fall to the earth

God knows we're worth it
No, I won't give up

I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use
The tools and gifts we got, yeah, we got a lot at stake
And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend
For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I've got, and what I'm not
And who I am

Your word is your access, your mouth is your door
Let’s slide down inside there, and see what's in store
In the middle there’s a rhythm picking, it's a freaking hard beat
At the bottom there’s a lot of water keeping your soul deep

Yes!,2014,Love Someone,"Love is a funny thing
Whenever I give it, it comes back to me
And it's wonderful to be
Giving with my whole heart
As my heart receives
Your love

Oh, ain't it nice tonight we've got each other
And I am right beside you
More than just a partner or a lover
I'm your friend

When you love someone
Your heartbeat beats so loud
When you love someone
Your feet can't feel the ground

Shining stars all seem
To congregate around your face
When you love someone
It comes back to you

And love is a funny thing
It's making my blood flow with energy
And it's like an awakened dream
As what I've been wishing for, is happening
And it's right on time

Lifting up to touch the starlight
And we will savor every second
We suspend together
You and I will
You and I will
You and I will

Your feet can't feel the ground

Yes!,2014,"Hello, You Beautiful Thing","Fall out of bed and catch a fading star
Fancy, I woke up before my alarm
Rub my mind through my eyes, it's the best I can do
Before it's automatic habit of returning to you
Though I smile when it happens almost as if it was magic
It means there's a God somewhere and He's laughing
And I shuffle my slipper-less toes to the kitchen
Still low to the ground, but high on living

And I know, I know, it's gonna be a good day
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing

Waking up, I stretch my body and acknowledge some aches
It must be something I did yesterday
Pour a cup of liquid gold, because my engine's still cold
But in a minute everything's gonna change

'Cause I know, I know, it's gonna be a good day
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing

And this is what I've been waiting for

Looking out from a cul-de-sac watching the bend
Of the Earth take the black of the night from the dirt
I can see from the depths of my readjusting eyes
A reflection of yes's and that ever-changing sky
But why do bad dreams linger long after I awake
I don't need no scenes of violence or pain replayed
And I feel quite foolish sometimes when I pray
But my thoughts are all I got so I try to make 'em brave

And I know, I know, it's gonna be a good day
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing

Is I pause, I take a breath, and bow and I let that chapter end
I design my future bright not by where my life has been

Yes I try, try, try, try, try again

Searching for the sunshine
Looking for a good time
Following the good vibes
Listening to intuition when it's happening
Diggin' into life cause at times it can be saddening
Yea it can be a grey day, if you're lonely
A little rain suddenly turns heavy
But a whole lot of love can make the clouds go away
Maybe the time for us is now

When the table's set for two
And there's nobody with you
Seeing movies by yourself

Unlonely ain't a word but I don't give a FRUCK
Cause I'm fresh from the farm where critics can't bother me
Living is tricky as it is so that ain't stopping me
You and me we both agree that no one needs the scrutiny
All we want is peace and love and honestly you ruined me
With your beautiful smile and your style continuity
I'd be a fool not to take the opportunity to say
Hey, we should be homies
I think we could be bigger than cheese and macaroni
We could keep it sweet like Chachi and Joanie
Or maybe just be ourselves: Never Phony
Never second guessing the friendship connection
Parallel living, never in possession
Of your individual personal expression
Together we're just a much better reflection of Love

And there's nobody with you
Seeing movies by yourself
Let me be your someone else
If you're spending time alone
If it's just you and your phone
Taking pictures of yourself
Baby, maybe I can help

It could be love
And we could be homies
Once you get to know me
I could be your one and only
I could make you unlonely
Or we could take it slowly
And we could keep it low key
I could be your one and only
I could make you unlonely

But you were nowhere
Oh love, you were nowhere at home

Look For The Good,2020,Take The Music,"With the help of vibration through tone and rhythm
The human is forgiven and the soul gets back to living
Returns us all to our natural condition
Turns up the levels on the mind's inner visions
It plays through the space to where you are
And regulates the beating of the broken hearts
A sensation in everybody's pants
Which is why when there is music, life becomes a dance

I take the music everywhere I go
I take the music everywhere I go

Motion is the nature of vibration
It contains a thought and feeling
A baby's first pleasure is to shake its hands and feet and move
And rock the body right
Proving that motion is a sign of life
Obey your body language
It's sending a message
That doesn't ever have to touch the tongue to be expressive
I'm an instrument the spirit gets to play
I sing and I dance all day

I take the music (Music)
Everywhere I go (I go, I go, I go)

Everybody's welcome
From the whisper of the trees, to the elephant that's belting
Raising hell is every bat and every bee
Every cat and every creature has a song for me
We ain't man made
We all come from nature
Every one of us is a brother and a sister
One World
We're a family of One
Where even the smallest bird hums
Even the smallest bird

There is music in our voices
Even when no words are spoken
Our bodies can speak louder than when our mouths are open
There's an under riding common frequency
That keeps us all aligned in divine harmony
Any scale, any note, any style, any meter
Music is the reason that we love to burn the reefer
Put that on record and spin it around

And now I'm hoping to move along
Away from any voice that makes me think I am wrong
I need focus
No hocus pocus
I'm gonna throw my freaking phone in the ocean

Who's sorry? I'm not sorry (Who's sorry? I'm not sorry)
Who's sorry? I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)

Because it's time to take a time
Time, time, time to take a time out (Time out)
Lay down & take-a time
Time, time, time to take a time out (Time out)
It's time to take a time
Time, time, time to take a time out (Time out)
4: 20 is the time
Time, time, time to take a time out (Time out)

Out of respect-a
I request-a
That we take a little time to siesta
Save the drama
For your mama
'Cause this ain't Broadway
I'll remind ya
I require
Time to re-stoke proverbial fire
And retire
A la playa
Because life is a beach anyway

I'm taking it easy (Taking it easy)
I'm taking it slow (Taking it slow)
You bet I'm taking it easy (Taking it easy)
I'm taking it slow

Tick a tick a tock a dis is no time to rock
Tick a tick a tock a this a must Spliff-a-clock
Excuse me while I light mi likkle ting upon the dock
Time fi mi self ah man a mi nuh need nuh flock
Undivided & provided by mi brethren 'round the block
The sky-grade a my-grade, it loud like a glock
Sticky like a sitten whey dem have inna the stock
Time to meditate a mi seh time to get knock

Are you medicated & the answer is yes
Too bless to be stressed & even when mi penny less
Mi nuh worry none at all a chaos mi nuh digest
Light another one & circumnavigate the stress
Sorry everybody but mi haffi confess
Product of the ghetto now mi living in the west
Mi nuh hesitate when mi burning the best
Mi nuh hesitate when mi burning the best

It's time to take a time
Time, time, time, to take a time out (Time out)
Slow down & take a time
Time, time, time to take a time out (Time out)
Take a time
Time, time, time, time to take a time out (Time out)
Slow down & take a time
Time, time, time to take a time out
(Mi nuh hesitate when mi burning the best)

I'm 365 days of fun
I'm grateful for my blessings on a daily basis
365 means no vacations
I'm infinite & endless, just like outer space is
A cousin to the planet's 7 billion faces
I spin around the sun
I go through moon phases
My calendar is busy 'cause I'm busy going places
Enjoying the ride in all its various stages
Enjoying this time before the season changes
My DJ name DJ FM AM JJASON

My DJ name DJ FM AM JJASON
Like the Goddesses & Gods, I know my spirit is ancient
My game moves slow
At natural paces
Remembering to breathe is my meditation
My pen is my sword, I draw blood on these pages
I make love not war because peace is courageous
These beats are persuasive to raise our vibrations with love & appreciation
I ain't giving up this job to robotic automation
I take the music making my own radio station
My DJ name is just a fun abbreviation
This song is a dedication

To send you my love (Send you my love)

My DJ name DJ FM AM JJASON
I focus not on drama but on recreation
I'm planting new seeds for regeneration
Awakening dreams out of suspended animation
My resolutions renew because we change some
Every revolution is part of the equation
Multisyllabic sing-alongs are still my favorite
'Cause there's 99 digits & a comma just ain't one
We share the same DJ name 'cause it's famous
It's an acronym of calendar pages
From December to November we're in constant rotation

Look For The Good,2020,Hearing Double,"I love you so much I have to say it twice
Just incase you didn't hear me the first time
You are the most beautiful girl I ever laid my eyes on
And I wish you'd let me call you mine

Love might be no trouble at all
Love might make you hear double if you fall
Love might be no trouble this night
Love might make you stutter when its right

Tell me what your thinking
With no delay (Delay)

Do I even stand a chance to score a date
(Double, date)

I feel so damned crazy
My poor heart could break
That's why I sing love songs
Everyday
Everyday

Love might be no trouble at all
Love might make you hear double if you fall

Love might be no trouble this night (That's right)
Love might make you stutter when its right

But love might make you stutter when its right

But love might make you stutter when its right"
Look For The Good,2020,The Minute I Heard Of Love,"I looked under every rock and under every moon
I looked in every favourite spot
I looked in all of my favourite tunes
I looked all over the world
What else was I supposed to do?

No matter where I find myself
I find myself looking for you

The minute I heard of love I started looking for you
The minute I heard of love I started looking for you
The minute I heard of love I started looking for you
The minute I heard of love I started looking for you

Some say love is blindness
Some say God is love
Some say love is kindness
Well, it's all of the above
I hope there's a life after death
'Cause there's so much left here I wanna do

Yeah, no matter how I find myself
I find myself looking for you

The minute I heard of love I started looking for you
The minute I heard of love I started looking for you
The minute I heard of love I started looking for you
The minute I heard of love I started looking for you

When I was 12 years old
And undergoing so many changes
Emotionally out of control
Hair coming out of new places
I started feeling myself
What else is a boy to do?

And no matter when I found myself
I define myself looking for you

The minute I heard of love I started looking for you
The minute I heard of love I started looking for you
The minute I heard of love I started looking for you
The minute I heard of love I started looking for you"
Look For The Good,2020,Gratitude,"I'm so grateful
I'm so grateful

I thank the boys who kicked my ass when I was seventeen
I thank the ones who chose to laugh and those who acted mean
I thank the bullies for all their scraps and accidents and then some
They shaped my life
They made me like who I've become
They shaped my life
They made me love who I am

I thank the girls who gave their hand and showed me how to dance
And I thank the ones who turned me down and never gave me a second chance
I learned that it's okay for hearts to go on their own way
They shaped my life
They made me like who I am today
They shaped my life
They made me love who I am

Look For The Good,2020,Before It All Ends,"It hasn't rained in a hundred days
But the waters still rising in other ways
The world may soon be going down the drain
I just want more time with my baby before it all ends
It's getting hot, it was hotter today
I hope tomorrow we can still go out and play
The world may soon be going up in flames
I just want more time with my baby before it all ends

Before it all ends
Because a meteor came crashing on our beds
Before it all ends
Because our president threw nuclear warheads
Before it all ends
Because the internet done swallowed all my friends
I just want more time with my baby before it all ends

Of all that's been not much remains
The only constant thing is change
The world may soon be going down the commode
I just want more time with my baby before we explode

Before it all ends
Because the earth is flat and we all went over the edge
Before it all ends
Because we all got anal probed by aliens
Before it all ends
Because everyone thought dollars made more sense
I just want more time with my baby before it all ends
I just want more time with my baby before it all ends
This is not a joke
I just want more time with my baby before it all ends"
Look For The Good,2020,Be Where Your Feet Are,"Feels like I'm surfing on a soundwave
Zooming through the universe
Feels like we're bouncing off of lightwaves
A bounce so hard sometimes it hurts, mmh-hm

Well every time I think I'm stuck
The sun moves along and my shadow gets up
If you're lost (if you're lost) relax (relax)
And be where your feet are (and be where your feet are)

Uh, yeah

Every time I try to follow someone's way
My end result is not the same
But then I do that thing, that thing I do that's just for me
And amazing things start happening, and again and again and

Every time I think I'm stuck
The sun moves along and my shadow gets up
If you're lost (if you're lost) relax (relax)
And be where your feet are (be where your feet are)

Outer space is where I'm spacing out
Still looking up when I'm feeling down, mmh-hm
I try to walk the talk, I talk but the tail is taller
When I look up, it's still too easy to feel small, still I found
If you're lost (if you're lost) just relax (relax)
And be where your feet are (be where your feet are)

If you ever get lost (if you're lost) relax (relax)
And be where your feet are (be where your feet are)
If you ever get lost (if you ever get lost) kick back (relax)
And be where your feet are (be where your feet are)
If you ever get lost (if you ever get lost) kick back (relax)
And be where your feet are, be where your feet are
I'm gon' be right here"
